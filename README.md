# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

**Important Note: The Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functionality in this project is currently simulated for demonstration purposes.** The flows in `src/ai/flows/credential-flow.ts` generate a placeholder proof string. A full production implementation would require integrating a dedicated ZKP framework (like Circom or ZoKrates) to generate and verify real cryptographic proofs. This simulation serves as a placeholder for where that complex logic would be integrated. **Do not use this application for real, sensitive passwords in its current state.**
