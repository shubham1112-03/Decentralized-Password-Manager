# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

**Important Security Note: The Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functionality in this project is currently SIMULATED for demonstration purposes.** 

The flows in `src/ai/flows/credential-flow.ts` generate a placeholder proof string (e.g., `simulated-zkp-for-...`). A full production implementation would require integrating a dedicated ZKP framework (like Circom or ZoKrates) to generate and verify real cryptographic proofs. This simulation serves as a placeholder for where that complex logic would be integrated.

**Do not use this application for real, sensitive passwords in its current state.**
