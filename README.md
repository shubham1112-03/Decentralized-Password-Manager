# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

**Important Note:** The Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functionality in this project is currently **simulated for demonstration purposes**. The flows in `src/ai/flows/credential-flow.ts` generate a placeholder proof string. A full implementation would require integrating a dedicated ZKP framework like Circom or ZoKrates to generate and verify real cryptographic proofs. This simulation serves as a placeholder for where that logic would be integrated.
