# CipherSafe Project Report

## Chapter 1: Introduction

In an era of escalating digital threats, the security of online credentials has become paramount. Traditional password management solutions, while convenient, often rely on centralized servers to store vast quantities of sensitive user data. This architectural model introduces a significant risk: a single successful breach can expose the encrypted vaults of millions of users, making these services a high-value target for attackers. The core problem lies in the centralization of trust and data, creating a single point of failure that, if compromised, has catastrophic consequences. This project, CipherSafe, confronts this challenge by fundamentally rethinking the architecture of password management, moving from a centralized model to a decentralized one grounded in the principle of zero-knowledge.

This report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of CipherSafe, a decentralized password manager that ensures only the user has access to their credentials, with no central authority capable of decrypting their data. The project's primary objective was to build a system where security is guaranteed by cryptographic proofs and distributed architecture, rather than by trust in a single service provider. We achieved this by integrating a suite of modern cryptographic techniques and decentralized technologies. The core of our solution involves encrypting user passwords with the robust AES-256-GCM standard, with the encryption key itself being derived from a user's master password via the memory-hard Argon2 hashing algorithm.

To eliminate the single point of failure associated with storage, we employed a novel strategy. Instead of storing the encrypted credential in one location, it is first fragmented using Shamir's Secret Sharing. This cryptographic scheme splits the data into multiple unique "shares," where a certain threshold of shares is required to reconstruct the original secret, but any individual share is cryptographically useless on its own. These encrypted, fragmented shares are then distributed across the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer network for data storage. This ensures that no single server holds a complete copy of the user's encrypted data.

The application's logic and architecture were built using a modern, full-stack approach. The user interface was developed using Next.js and React, providing a responsive, cross-platform web application. The complex backend operations, including the orchestration of encryption, fragmentation, and IPFS distribution, were managed by Google's Genkit AI framework. For user management and the storage of non-sensitive metadata—such as the pointers (CIDs) to the IPFS fragments—we utilized Firebase Authentication and Firestore, respectively. It is critical to note that while this architecture fully realizes decentralization in its storage of sensitive data, it still relies on Firebase for service availability. Additionally, while the system is designed to incorporate Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for password verification, the current implementation simulates this step, providing a clear path for future work to integrate a formal ZKP framework like Circom or ZoKrates.

The outcome of this project is a functional, proof-of-concept application that successfully demonstrates a more secure and resilient model for password management. It validates the feasibility of combining advanced cryptography with decentralized storage to build systems that empower users with true ownership and control over their digital identities. This introductory chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of the project's motivation, design, and results. The subsequent chapters of this report will delve into the specific details of the system's architecture, cryptographic implementation, security model, and final evaluation.
