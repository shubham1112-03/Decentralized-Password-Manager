# CipherSafe Project Report

## Chapter 1: Introduction

In an era of escalating digital threats, the security of online credentials has become paramount. Traditional password management solutions, while convenient, often rely on centralized servers to store vast quantities of sensitive user data. This architectural model introduces a significant risk: a single successful breach can expose the encrypted vaults of millions of users, making these services a high-value target for attackers. The core problem lies in the centralization of trust and data, creating a single point of failure that, if compromised, has catastrophic consequences. This project, CipherSafe, confronts this challenge by fundamentally rethinking the architecture of password management, moving from a centralized model to a decentralized one grounded in the principle of zero-knowledge.

This report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of CipherSafe, a decentralized password manager that ensures only the user has access to their credentials, with no central authority capable of decrypting their data. The project's primary objective was to build a system where security is guaranteed by cryptographic proofs and distributed architecture, rather than by trust in a single service provider. We achieved this by integrating a suite of modern cryptographic techniques and decentralized technologies. The core of our solution involves encrypting user passwords with the robust AES-256-GCM standard, with the encryption key itself being derived from a user's master password via the memory-hard Argon2 hashing algorithm.

To eliminate the single point of failure associated with storage, we employed a novel strategy. Instead of storing the encrypted credential in one location, it is first fragmented using Shamir's Secret Sharing. This cryptographic scheme splits the data into multiple unique "shares," where a certain threshold of shares is required to reconstruct the original secret, but any individual share is cryptographically useless on its own. These encrypted, fragmented shares are then distributed across the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer network for data storage. This ensures that no single server holds a complete copy of the user's encrypted data.

The application's logic and architecture were built using a modern, full-stack approach. The user interface was developed using Next.js and React, providing a responsive, cross-platform web application. The complex backend operations, including the orchestration of encryption, fragmentation, and IPFS distribution, were managed by Google's Genkit AI framework. For user management and the storage of non-sensitive metadata—such as the pointers (CIDs) to the IPFS fragments—we utilized Firebase Authentication and Firestore, respectively. It is critical to note that while this architecture fully realizes decentralization in its storage of sensitive data, it still relies on Firebase for service availability. Additionally, while the system is designed to incorporate Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for password verification, the current implementation simulates this step, providing a clear path for future work to integrate a formal ZKP framework like Circom or ZoKrates.

The outcome of this project is a functional, proof-of-concept application that successfully demonstrates a more secure and resilient model for password management. It validates the feasibility of combining advanced cryptography with decentralized storage to build systems that empower users with true ownership and control over their digital identities. This introductory chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of the project's motivation, design, and results. The subsequent chapters of this report will delve into the specific details of the system's architecture, cryptographic implementation, security model, and final evaluation.

## Chapter 2: Significance of the Problem and System

This chapter explores the critical importance of the problem CipherSafe addresses. It discusses the inherent risks of centralized security models and identifies the key stakeholders who would, and should, care about the development of decentralized alternatives.

The digital world is built on credentials. From banking and email to social media and healthcare, our lives are managed through a series of usernames and passwords. The systemic problem is that the predominant method for securing these credentials—centralized password managers—concentrates immense risk into a single, high-value target. A successful attack on a major password manager service could expose the "keys to the kingdom" for millions of individuals and businesses simultaneously, leading to catastrophic financial loss, identity theft, and breaches of personal privacy. The importance of this problem grows daily as more of our sensitive activities move online, making the services that guard our digital identities a foundational layer of modern society.

The work undertaken in the CipherSafe project should be of significant interest to several key groups:

1.  **The General Public**: Every individual who uses the internet has a vested interest in the security of their digital identity. For the average user, a password manager is the first line of defense against account takeover. They should care that the very tool designed to protect them does not itself become the weakest link in their security chain. CipherSafe offers a model where users do not have to place blind trust in a company's security practices, but can instead rely on the mathematical guarantees of cryptography and decentralization.

2.  **Security Professionals and Researchers**: This group is constantly seeking more robust and resilient security architectures. Centralization is often viewed as a necessary evil for convenience, but it is also an accepted point of weakness. CipherSafe serves as a practical case study in "trust minimization," demonstrating how to build a usable system that removes the need for a trusted third party to hold sensitive data. It provides a tangible example of applying advanced concepts like Shamir's Secret Sharing and distributed storage (IPFS) to solve a common, real-world problem.

3.  **Privacy Advocates and Technologists**: Those who advocate for user data ownership and digital sovereignty should care deeply about this work. The CipherSafe model empowers the user with ultimate control over their own data. By design, not even the operators of the CipherSafe service can access or decrypt user information. This aligns with a broader movement toward building a more private and user-centric web, where individuals are not merely products whose data is to be monetized or protected at the whim of a corporation, but are true owners of their digital lives.
